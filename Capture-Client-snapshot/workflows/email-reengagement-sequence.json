We may have missed something in our initial conversation\n2. Your situation may have changed\n3. We've added new features that might be relevant\n4. I want to understand what we could have done better\n\nWHAT'S CHANGED SINCE WE LAST TALKED:\n\nA lot has happened at Capture Client:\n\n✓ New affordable starter packages (from $999/month)\n✓ Even faster setup (now 24-48 hours)\n✓ Expanded CRM capabilities\n✓ Multi-language support\n✓ Enhanced analytics dashboard\n✓ 500+ businesses now served (was 300+ when we talked)\n\nCOMMON REASONS FOR NOT MOVING FORWARD:\n\n\"Not the right time\"\n- Has timing improved?\n- What would make it the right time?\n\n\"Budget concerns\"\n- We've added more affordable options\n- Most clients see 3-5x ROI within 90 days\n- Month-to-month, no long-term commitment\n\n\"Need to think about it\"\n- What specific concerns can I address?\n- Would another demo help?\n\n\"Went with another solution\"\n- How's that working out?\n- Many clients come to us after trying alternatives\n\n\"Just not interested anymore\"\n- Totally fair! Mind sharing why?\n- Your feedback helps us improve\n\nTHE INDUSTRY IS MOVING FAST:\n\nSince we last talked:\n- 73% more businesses are using AI Voice Agents\n- Average lead response time has dropped 80%\n- Companies without AI automation are losing market share\n\nThe question isn't \"if\" you'll adopt AI, it's \"when.\"\n\nWill it be before or after your competitors?\n\nNO PRESSURE, JUST CHECKING IN:\n\nI'd genuinely love to reconnect and understand where you're at.\n\nEven if you're not interested in Capture Client, maybe I can help in another way:\n- Share best practices\n- Recommend other solutions\n- Provide industry insights\n- Just chat about lead generation challenges\n\n15 minutes?",

        "body": "I haven't heard back from you, which is totally fine! Decision-making takes time.\n\nI wanted to share the top 5 concerns we hear from prospects and how we address them:\n\nCONCERN #1: \"It sounds too good to be true\"\nREALITY: We have 500+ active clients with a 4.9/5 rating. Here are real results:\n- Nashville marketing agency: 67% more qualified leads\n- Knoxville real estate team: 42% revenue increase in 90 days\n- Atlanta home services: 80% reduction in missed opportunities\n\nCONCERN #2: \"What if it doesn't work for my business?\"\nREALITY: 30-day money-back guarantee. We've only had 3 refund requests in 2 years (all were bad-fit industries we shouldn't have accepted).\n\nCONCERN #3: \"My team won't like it\"\nREALITY: Your team will LOVE it because:\n- They stop doing repetitive qualification calls\n- They only talk to pre-qualified, interested leads\n- They have more time for actual selling\n- Their close rates go up\n\nCONCERN #4: \"The technology is too complex\"\nREALITY: You don't need to understand the tech. We handle:\n- All setup and integration (48 hours)\n- Ongoing maintenance and updates\n- Training and support\n- Continuous optimization\n\nYou just watch the results come in.\n\nCONCERN #5: \"I need to think about it / talk to my team\"\nREALITY: Absolutely! This is a business decision. Take your time.\n\nBUT CONSIDER:\nEvery day you wait:\n- Competitors might be using AI (they probably are)\n- You're losing 30% of leads to slow response times\n- Your team is burning out on repetitive calls\n- Your ad spend isn't maximized\n\nCOST OF DELAY:\nIf you're spending $3,000/month on ads and losing 30% to poor follow-up, that's $900/month wasted. Over a year: $10,800.\n\nOur most expensive package is $2,195/month and pays for itself in recaptured leads alone.\n\nYOUR PROPOSAL:\n{{proposal_link}}\n\nSPECIAL OFFER EXPIRES IN 2 DAYS:\n- $500 setup fee waived\n- Month 1 CRM free\n- Priority onboarding\n\nWhat's the real hesitation?",
